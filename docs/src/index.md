**Turing** is a *universal* probabilistic programming language with an intuitive modelling interface, composable probabilistic inference and computational scalability.

Turing provides **Hamiltonian Monte Carlo** (HMC) and **particle MCMC** sampling algorithms for complex posterior distributions (e.g. those involving discrete variables and stochastic control flows). Current features include:

- **Universal** probabilistic programming with an intuitive modelling interface;
- **Hamiltonian Monte Carlo** (HMC) sampling for differentiable posterior distributions;
- **Particle MCMC** sampling for complex posterior distributions involving discrete variables and stochastic control flow; and
- **Gibbs** sampling that combines particle MCMC,  HMC and many other MCMC algorithms.
